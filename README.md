# IoT Workshop - Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences #

## Introduction ##
The Internet of Things is a development that is of interest to a growing number of people, many of whom have no knowledge about the technology that drives IoT related innovations. People such as interaction designers, industrial product designers, business developers, data analysts may play an important role in designing IoT related applications, but they would still feel that the underlying technology will never be within their grasp. 

The following workshop is constructed to provide those people an enjoyable hands-on workshops at which they can learn about the basics of IoT technology and what it can do for them. In a two hour workshop it should be possible for participants to fabricate an internet connected device themselves.
